                <p class="banner-content">The Tau.4 uses an ortholinear layout, in the 40% size. It lays out all the keys in a perfect grid, which helps reduce strain.
                The stagger on regular keyboards is a standard from the days of typewriters, and hasn't been changed since. The angle can be unnatural, putting strain on your fingers when typing. <br><br>
                The 40% size means your fingers never need to move more than 1 key away from the home row, reducing larger movements to access things like numbers and symbols.
                And thanks to the powerful layers feature of the QMK firmware, all the keys you need are still accessible via the 2 layer keys - Lower and Raise - on either side of the spacebar.
                With these, you can access all the keys of a full size keyboard, simply by holding one of the keys with your thumb.</p>
