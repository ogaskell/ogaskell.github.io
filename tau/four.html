                <p class="banner-content">I'm currently waiting on the final prototypes to arrive from the manufacturer. As soon as they arrive, I can check that everything is as I want it and the final PCBs can be ordered.<br>Once I've got the prototypes, as well as checking everything is ok I'll also be making an assembly guide so keep an eye out for that! I'll also be updating all the photos on the site.</p>

                <div class="banner-content">
                    <p>The Group buy is going to be going live next Friday, 5th February! Prices and kit contents/upgrade options have now been finalised, see below.</p>
                    <p>Since I’m running a fairly low volume – max 25 units – I’m just going to be running it through a google form since eCommerce platforms are too expensive. You won’t need to submit any personal details through the form, just which options you want and your email, and I’ll contact you for payment details, address, shipping costs etc. </p>
                    <p>When it goes live, I’ll post the link on this page, as well as an email to everyone on the IC list, an announcement on my <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=profile;u=127790">geekhack</a> and on r/MechMarket.</p>

                    <p>And an update on the hotswap options – after the poll earlier this week, the most popular option was Kailh hotswap sockets, so that’s what I’ll be using. This means the price has gone up by £5 – to £35 and £55 – since all PCBs will come with Kailh hotswap sockets. I’ve redesigned the PCB to use them, and everything is ready for production once the GB is done.</p>

                <div class="banner-content">
                    <p>The Tau.4 uses an ortholinear layout, in the 40% size. </p>

                    <h4>Why ortholinear?</h4>
                    <p>Ortholinear layouts lay out all the keys in a perfect grid, which helps reduce strain when typing. Your fingers move straight up and down between rows, instead of at an unnatural angle.
                        The stagger on regular keyboards is a standard from the days of typewriters, and hasn't been changed since. The angle can be unnatural, putting strain on your fingers when typing. </p>
                    <h4>Why 40%?</h4>
                    <p>The 40% size means your fingers never need to move more than 1 key away from the home row, reducing larger movements to access things like numbers and symbols, which can cause strain when typing for longer periods.</p>
                    <h4>Doesn't this mean you lose keys? Where are the numbers?</h4>
                    <p>Thanks to the powerful layers feature of the QMK firmware, all the keys you need are still accessible via the 2 layer keys - Lower and Raise - on either side of the spacebar.
                        With these, you can access all the keys of a full size keyboard, simply by holding one of the keys with your thumb.</p>

                            <li>
                                <h4>OLED Display</h4>
                                <p>The mini OLED display in the top right of the keyboard displays useful information such as the current active layer, current WPM and more, all configurable through QMK.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Rotary Encoder Support</h4>
                                <p>A rotary encoder can optionally be installed in one of 4 locations on the keyboard, allowing controlls such as volume control, scrolling, etc., programmable in QMK.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Kailh Hotswap sockets</h4>
                                <p>The Tau.4 comes with Kailh hotswap sockets, which allow keyswitches to be installed and removed without soldering, making installing, changing or modding switches easy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>RGB Underglow</h4>
                                <p>The RGB upgrade adds 10 underglow LEDs around the edge of the PCB, programmable with various lighting effects and layer indicators.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>USB Type C</h4>
                                <p>The Tau4 comes with USB Type C as standard, the modern standard for USB connectors. It's reversible, much more durable than other connectors and the most widely used on modern keyboards. This also means with a USB C to C cable, you can connect to PCs, Laptops, Phones, Tablets and more.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Multiple Layout Options</h4>
                                <p>The spacebar area of the Tau4 has multiple options for layouts - full grid layout for maximum functionality and programmability, one spacebar for the easiest, most standard layout, or 2 spacebars for use with tap-hold layer keys, or wider layer keys.</p>
                            </li>
